### The BIG O Asymptotic Analysis & Scalability

## What is good code?
 - Readable
 - Scalable

 How can we make sure there is a way for us to measure efficient code? Big O notation is the language we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run. 

 We can compare 2 functions using Big O and ask which function takes longer to run.

 See Big-O complexity chart.

 ## Algorithmic efficiency
How an increase in our inputs(Elements) affects the increase of Operations.


When we talk about BIG O we simply mean when we grow larger, how much does the algorithm slow down. The less it slows down, the better it is (aka the more efficient it is).
